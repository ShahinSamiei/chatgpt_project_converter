## Description
    This project provides a set of Python scripts to work with directory structures and file contents. It allows you to save the structure of a directory tree, the contents of files, and also recreate a project from a text file representation. These tools are useful for documenting projects, backing up file structures, or rebuilding projects from textual representations.

## Files

### doc.py
    This script reads all files in a specified folder, retrieves their contents, and saves it into a single text file. It documents each file including its relative path and handles errors encountered during file reading.

### main.py
    This script saves both the directory structure and the contents of the files within a directory, combining both into a single output file.

### project.py
    This script recreates a projectâ€™s folder and file structure from a text file representation of the directory and its contents.

### tree.py
    This script focuses on saving the directory structure in a tree format, without file contents.
